# ESP32 Temperature & Humidity Sensor with BLE Beacon

Hello! This project was a path for me to delve deeper into using FreeRTOS, I2C protocols, and BLE concepts in a real world setting. I created a comprehensive IoT temperature and humidity monitoring system built on the ESP32 platform using ESP-IDF framework. This project combines DHT22 sensor readings, OLED display output, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon functionality for wireless data transmission.

## üîç Overview

This project continuously reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor, displays the information on an SSD1306 OLED screen, and broadcasts the temperature data via BLE beacon using the Eddystone TLM (Telemetry) format.

### Key Capabilities:
- **Real-time Environmental Monitoring**: Continuous temperature and humidity sensing
- **Visual Display**: Local data visualization on OLED screen
- **Wireless Data Broadcasting**: BLE beacon transmission for remote monitoring
- **Multi-tasking Architecture**: Efficient FreeRTOS-based task management
- **Data Buffering**: Ring buffer implementation for sensor data history
